            I first encountered HTML & CSS in the entrepreneurship course I took
            in college, it blew my mind how lines of code can make a fraction of
            my vision come to life, of course JS was still too far ahead of me
            but it was such an enjoyable experience. As a creative person,
            creating something out of a blank canvas was satisfying and
            exciting!

            I went on being a pastry chef and an early childhood educator, both
            allowed me to express my creativity and taught me how to be
            methodical, follow structures, processes and procedures. They
            enhanced my problem-solving skills and revealed my weaknesses which
            I was able to work on through performing different roles. For
            example, I didnâ€™t think of myself as a natural born leader, but
            working in the kitchen for almost 6 years pushed me to manage
            people. These years trained me how to be empathetic whilst being
            goal-oriented.

          <p className="mb-2">
            Being a software engineer requires me to practice all the skills I
            have learned from my previous roles and some more. This became
            evident to me when I started the software engineering program an
            intensive full-time program which taught me programming
            fundamentals, languages, frameworks, libraries and best-practices.
